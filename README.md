jqzoom_rsp
==========

ResourceSpace plugin to use JQZoom (http://www.mind-projects.it/projects/jqzoom/) for zooming images on mouseover. It borrows from the MagicTouch RS plugin by Dan Huby.

This plugin requires the following:
* A version of ResourceSpace that includes jquery
* If you want zooms on the Edit page, you will need a custom hook. This can be added by applying extras/add_edit_hook.patch.
